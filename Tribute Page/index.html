            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>1) Sushant Singh Rajput was born in Patna in the state of Bihar to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha
                    Singh. His father is a retired technical officer and worked at Bihar State Handloom Corporation in
                    Patna. He was the youngest of five siblings and had the nickname Gulshan. One of his four sisters
                    Mitu Singh was a state-level cricket player. He attended the St. Karen's High School in Patna. His
                    family moved to Delhi following his mother's death in 2002 where Rajput completed his schooling for
                    intermediate studies in Kulachi Hansraj Model School.</li>
                <li>2) Rajput was reportedly an avid reader who was deeply interested in astrophysics and won the
                    National Olympiad in Physics. He secured admission in the Delhi College of Engineering (later
                    renamed Delhi Technological University) to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechanical
                    engineering. According to Rajput, he did not have any interest in engineering but his family gave
                    him no option which left him dissatisfied. He instead wanted to become an astronaut and later an air
                    force pilot but was also interested in Bollywood, being a fan of Shah Rukh Khan.

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>Rajput's personal relationships have been the subject of widespread media attention. In
                    2011, Rajput publicly proposed to his Pavitra Rishta co-star Ankita Lokhande during a national
                    broadcast of the dance competition show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa;[32] both of them had participated in the
                    show as competing contestants. The couple began dating after their first meeting on the set of
                    Pavitra Rishta, where they had been cast as husband and wife to each other. In 2012, they began
                    living together, and reports of an imminent marriage between the two occasionally cropped up in
                    the media. In an interview, Rajput stated that marriage and cohabitation were no different and
                    that it was hypocritical to treat the former as sacred and the latter as a crime. At an
                    event, he had said, "I am very transparent about my relationships. I mean I will not hesitate to say
                    that I am in a relationship".

                    In 2014, rumours that they were already secretly married due to family pressure were denied by
                    the couple. In January 2016, Rajput confirmed that a lavish wedding would take place in
                    December, but the relationship ended prior to that, with the pair maintaining silence on the
                    reasons for the cancellation. In a 2021 interview, Lokhande said that Rajput wanted to go ahead
                    in his career and they ended their relationship mutually.</li>

                    <br class="break">
                    During his course at the Delhi College of Engineering, Rajput enrolled himself in Shiamak Davar's
                    dance classes. Soon afterward, he also began attending acting classes under the theatre director
                    Barry John. Rajput later stated that he found the experience to be liberating and wanted to continue
                    doing it forever. He featured as a background dancer in the Dhoom Again song of Dhoom 2 and in
                    Aishwarya Rai's performance at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. In 2006, he
                    dropped out of his engineering course during his fourth year to begin a career in arts and
                    performance. He moved to Mumbai, took up odd jobs and small roles alongside working in the theatre
                    industry. Rajput eventually joined Nadira Babbar's theatre group called the Ekjute in which he
                    remained for two and a half years.

                <li>2) <b class="bold">2011–2015: Film debut and Yash Raj Films</b>
                    <br class="break">
                    In 2011, Rajput was spotted by Mukesh Chhabra, the casting director of Kai Po Che!, who invited him
                    for an audition. He was in the process of enrolling for a course in filmmaking at Stanford
                    University but decided to accept the offer.He was subsequently cast in the role of Ishaan Bhatt, a
                    district-level cricketer who was a victim of politics in the selection fraternity and one of the
                    three leads, along with Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh. The film was directed by Abhishek Kapoor and
                    based on the Chetan Bhagat novel called The 3 Mistakes of My Life, which dealt with the life of
                    three friends affected by the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and the 2002 Gujarat riots. It was released in
                    2013 and became a critical and commercial success. Rajput received a nomination for the Filmfare
                    Awards in the category of best debut actor for his performance in the film.

                <li>3) <b class="bold">2015–2018: Dhoni biopic, Raabta and Kedarnath</b>
                    <br class="break">
                    In 2011, a biopic on the life of the Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was conceived
                    by Dhoni's manager, Arun Pandey. The project was initially faced with various difficulties
                    including objections from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Dhoni's demand for a
                    large royalty. On 25 September 2014, Sushant Singh Rajput was announced as the actor who
                    would play the role of Dhoni in the biopic which was titled M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story and
                    directed by Neeraj Pandey. The film was centered around the life of the cricketer beginning
                    with his childhood in the city of Ranchi and leading up to the 2011 Cricket World Cup victory for
                    India under his captaincy. Incidentally, Rajput wasn't adept at cricket and had to train
                    regularly in the game for 13 months as well as capture the playing style of Dhoni for his portrayal
                    in the film, he was coached by Kiran More who reportedly trained him in the regimen of a
                    professional sportsperson rather than as an actor. The film was produced by Arun Pandey with Fox
                    Star Studios and released on 2 October 2016. It became the 5th highest grossing Bollywood film
                    of that year. Rajput received critical acclaim for his performance and nominations to a number
                    of awards, including the Filmfare Awards, the International Indian Film Academy Awards and the
                    winning nomination at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. He also made a cameo
                    appearance in the comedy film Welcome to New York, which was released on 23 February 2018 and
                    where the lead characters met Rajput but confused him for Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

                <li>On 14 June 2020, Rajput, aged 34, was found dead, hanging from the ceiling fan in his home in
                    Bandra, Mumbai. He had reportedly shown signs of clinical depression and was suffering from
                    bipolar disorder. The Mumbai Police commenced an investigation, stating that the death was being
                    treated as a suicide. The postmortem report stated that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to
                    hanging," and called it a "clear case of suicide." The autopsy doctors placed the time of death at
                    10 to 12 hours before postmortem examination on 14 June at 11:30 p.m.—meaning between 11:30 a.m. and
                    1:30 p.m. (Indian Standard Time). No foul play was found.The viscera report likewise ruled out foul
                    play. On 25 July, Rajput's family lodged a first information report with police in Patna, where his
                    father lives, accusing Rhea Chakraborty and five others of abetment of suicide.
